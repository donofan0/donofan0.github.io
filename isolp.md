## Irish School of Lanscape Painting  

The family business was teaching art classes, but we were unable to teach in person because of lockdown.  This means I set up an entire system for my Mother to teach online.  The first was the website [Link](https://irishcschooloflandscapepainting.com)https://irishcschooloflandscapepainting.com at this website. We run online painting classes every Tuesday morning.  This is Livestreamed from a filming studio I set up to Vimeo, rebroadcasted to our website.  These are also recorded and archived in a library of over 50 videos.

To attract more customers, I also developed both an android and IOS app. You can find these apps by searching "ISOLP Painting Class" on the apple app store or play store.  This app features in-app purchase for a subscription to premium content and a video player, live stream player, push notifications, live chat and Chromecast support on android.

There is also a macOS and TVs app in the works.
