## DeckNanny
Decknanny is an Arduino connected to a Raspberry PI, which runs all the lighting and water features on my deck.  This includes six relays for AC power, a 12v power supply for led lights, and addressable RGB LEDs in both the floorboards and under the bannisters.  This can be controlled from any device on my home network using a custom made apache website.  IT can also be controlled from Alexa via an SHH tunnel to a VPS server.
