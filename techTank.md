<p>The Exhibition was held in the <span style="color: red;"><b>RDS on the 13th to the 18th of December</b></span> in the Serpentine Hall 3.&nbsp; This is an exciting space of 40 x 30 m<span style="font-size: xx-small; vertical-align: top;">2</span>&nbsp;with room for 170 large paintings that were exhibited.&nbsp; Many of these painting had never been exhibited before and are available for purchase for a decerning eye. There was plenty of room for exploring the new Technologies that Kenneth and his Grandson Donovan, have “cooked up”.<br>

<p>The event was a total success on all accounts.&nbsp; Guests arrived with smiles and left with smiles.&nbsp; The atmosphere was exceptional with people thanking us for the experience to see this amazing collection of Kenneth’s works.&nbsp; The most often comment was how was it possible that at 92 Kenneth painted 12 new very large masterpieces with the energy of a 40-year-old.&nbsp; Donovan’s fast forward videos were a testament to this energy.&nbsp; Even Kenneth was amazed and commented to me “But they are fast forward”.&nbsp; &nbsp;I offered to show him them at normal speed which is equally amazing.</p>
<p>The Tec-Tank was a great success as well and there is a video posted here which shows the full exhibition for those that missed it, which contains the Tec-Tank.&nbsp; Those who came reached in and grabbed a poppy to take home.</p>
<p>There were many specialised events for invited guests hosted by ourselves and some of Kenneth’s most important Galleries as well as other entities who enjoyed being a part.&nbsp; Charities such as “Our Lives Matter”, “St. James Hospital Foundation”, “Cancer Care West” and others participated and raised much needed finance.<br>

<p>Some of the unsold painting&nbsp;perhaps are still available so please contact us if you see something you are interested in and we can see if it is something we are still willing to sell.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many of the&nbsp;paintings have been placed in the Kenneth Webb Foundation so that they will be available for the public in the future.</p>
